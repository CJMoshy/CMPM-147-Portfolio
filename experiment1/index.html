					This is the first assignment for CMPM 147 @UCSC. The goal of this project is to demonstrate simple procedual generation in the form of short text. There are two options available for use. First, you can click 'generate' to generate a simple recipe in a 
					'mad-lib' style format. This is done with simple regex pattern matching and string splicing. Thanks to Wes Modes @UCSC's CMPM dept. for providing the framework for this portion. The second button hooks up to a simple backend server that calls googles gemeni api,
					asking it the prompt 'write me a funny cooking recipe in 150 words'. Enjoy!
				</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Technical</h2>
				<p style="padding-top: 2%;">
					The first button provides a very simple example of procedural generation. Using JavaScript, a 2d array is defined, holding arrays of strings. The strings contain some pre-decided text which will be selected via regex pattern matching.
					Then a starter 'story' that has been modified with the appropriate regex strings scattered througout it is refrenced and iterated through until a regex pattern is matched.
					Once the pattern is matched, a simple function call replaces the pattern with the corresponding index of the previously mentioned array. The result is a (goofy) procedurally generated story.
				</p>
				<p style="padding-top: 2%;">
					The second button puts in a request to a small backend server that I wrote. This server calls googles gemeni model and prompts it for a funny recipe. The recipe is then returned and sent to the screen. I wrote the server using Node.js.
				</p>

				<p style="padding-top: 2%;">
					This was a unique introduction to procedual generation. I personally enjoyed creating the various strings for the main array of choices, as it felt similar to creating a 'choose your own adventure'.
