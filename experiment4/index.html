                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Here is my version of experiment 4 for CMPM 147. The theme of this project is infinite worlds. This
                    project uses vanilla javascript and p5 js to create an infinite tile renderer that is then iterated
                    on to build something more creative from the base engine. Through three unique sketches, there are
                    various programming techniques employed in order to encapsulate the essence of uniquely generated
                    and infinite worlds
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>
                    The first sketch is the simplest iteration of the base code. This was created by changing many of
                    the base rendering properties with a focus on enhancing the aesthetics of the sketch through
                    color variations and some basic mathematical techniques. Randomness is used to choose the tile color placement,
                    and a simple sparkle effect is added in as well. Finally, ellipses can be rendered to the screen
                    which will oscillate along the y-axis infinitely until toggled off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second sketch is another iteration on the base engine this time opting to use WEBGL to render
                    some 3D shapes instead of the original vertex-based tiles. This gives the project a fresh feel and
                    adds some depth and uniqueness to it. This was done by calling the cube function and adding some
                    logic to re-position the camera based on user clicks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third sketch is the most unique when compared to the starting point of the initial engine. This
                    sketch renders some cartoon-looking pine trees, in addition to some grassy patches that are
                    generated with Perlin noise. Finally, the user can click on tiles to render a pseudo-3D tile that
                    gives some depth to the sketch. This is achieved by using some translation logic and drawing some
                    thin lines to give the effect of depth and 3D
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on my work on this assignment, I think that I did a solid job of getting everything set
                    up and optimized. My program runs very smoothly and has minimal input lag. In addition, I was able
                    to do 3 unique renderings each with their special twist. However, looking at some of the other
                    peers' work, I will concede that my work is very simplistic when compared to some of the others. If
                    I were to do this assignment again, I would spend more time on one sketch to develop something that
                    is truly awe-inspiring. Regardless, I put a lot of time into getting everything set up the way it is
                    and ensuring user satisfaction via easy controls and minimal lag. I enjoyed this project, as I felt
                    that it was very interesting to dive deeper into the engine code and understand what goes into the
                    main logic behind what rendered the worlds endlessly.
